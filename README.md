# Binary Search Tree
Practicing algorithms through the creation of a balanced binary search tree (BBST) in JavaScript.

### Goal
- To practice implementing search algorithms.

### Challenges Faced
- Running into issues with scope: creating a private scope with functions by correctly declaring variables with const/let, to avoid variable conflict in the global space.
